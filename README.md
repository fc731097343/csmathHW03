run the MOG.py to visualise the 2D gaussion, n-D Guassion is also supported.
mu, sigma is the parameter of the disribution we wish to generate.


run the EM.py to show the process of EM algorithm of GMM clustering.
you should set the parameters of each gaussion distribution ahead
K is the number of actual gaussion


2D_Guassion.png shows one possible randomized generated gaussion data

You may run the hm03.ipynb to show the process of both programs
